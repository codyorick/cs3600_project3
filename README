This is a simple DNS client.
Usage: ./3600dns [-ns|-mx] @<server:port> <name>
Where server is the IP address of a DNS server, and name is the domain name to query for. The port field is optional. 
The -ns or -mx argument is also optional. Use -ns to query for a name server and -mx for a mail server.

From a high level, we first construct the header and packet appropriately, then send it. Then, the received
packet is parsed and the appropriate data is output.

We used structs for the headers, questions, and answers. We were also able to complete the extra credit.
